Options for running

1. activate environment, then run py files:
    - navigate to confocal_processing directory
    - activate environemt: poetry shell
    - run file: python confocal_processing\your_script.py

    What this does
    - enter a new shell with the virtual environment fully activated. every command
      you run in this shell will use the virtual environment's python and packages.
    - good for running multiple commands in the environment

2. run command without entering shell:
    - navigate to confocal_processing directory
    - run file right away: poetry run python your_script.py

    What this does
    - you don't enter a new shell. Each command you run with "poetry run" will temporarily activate the environment just for that command.
    - good for running single commands without needing to enter a new shell

**Current problem**
works when i do option 2, but if i try option 1, i get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'napari'
